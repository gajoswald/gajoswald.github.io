## Create a github account



We will be using github to host our individual website. In order to do this, we will need to make a github account.

### Frequently Asked Questions

* What is a repository


## Download and Install Github Desktop



[Here is the link](https://desktop.github.com/)

You will use this program to sync with your github account and perform the necessary operations for updating your webpage. 

After it is installed, you will need to connect it to your github account.

> This is actually an optional step, as everything can be run from the command line (once you have git installed), but the client works great!

* What is the command line?


## Clone the Repository

This will make a copy of the repository on your computer. You will specify where it lives. As you build your website, you will update the pages on your computer, commit them to the repository *on your computer*, then update the repository hosted on github with Github Desktop. 


## Install Ruby



#### App.js

```
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';
import '@tensorflow/tfjs-react-native';
```

This will trigger some magic in the Snack editor. It will ask you to add dependencies, which you should do, and then it will keep finding new dependencies to add. Keep adding them until it stops asking. In the end your package.json file should look something like this:

#### package.json

```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native-paper": "3.6.0",
    "expo-constants": "~9.3.1",
    "@tensorflow/tfjs": "*",
    "@tensorflow/tfjs-react-native": "*",
    "@react-native-community/async-storage": "~1.12.0",
    "@tensorflow/tfjs-backend-cpu": "2.7.0",
    "expo-asset": "~8.2.1",
    "@tensorflow/tfjs-backend-webgl": "2.7.0",
    "expo-camera": "~9.1.0",
    "react-native-fs": "2.14.1",
    "expo-gl": "~9.2.0",
    "prop-types": "15.6.0",
    "@tensorflow/tfjs-core": "2.7.0"
  }
}
```
