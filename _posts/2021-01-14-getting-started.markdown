I am in the middle of creating a tutorial for how I made this [github.io website](tutorials/githubio-website) going to create a tutorial for how I made this very soon, but the gist is that you: 
1. create a github account (there may be details for how to do this within the school)
2. Install github desktop
3. Create a github.io repository
4. install ruby
5. install jekyll
6. create a jekyll site
7. push the changes

There isn't much code involved, but you'll want to start to get a feel for how markdown works.
